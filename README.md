## React Hook Form + Zod + Flowbite Example

This project demonstrates a simple React application that primarily focuses on:

- **react-hook-form** for form state management and validation
- **zod** for schema-based validation
- **flowbite** for UI components and styling

The code showcases how to integrate these libraries to build modern, type-safe forms with a clean user interface.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Folder Structure

- `src/` — Main source code (see `App.tsx` for the form example)
- `public/` — Static assets

## Technologies Used

- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite-react.com/)
